			<p>Hello, my name is Chyi and I'm applying to General Assembly because I love to code!  I recently discovered my passion for coding while at work. I grew tired of doing the same redundant tasks so I decided to learn how to automate my work by writing a script.</p>

      <p>What I've come to love most about programming is how I'll never get bored unless I want to, there's always something new to learn. When I code I feel like I'm solving a conceptualized puzzle and I find that challenging and fun.</p>

      <p>When I'm not teaching myself to code I play my fair share of boardgames, try new restaurants around Seattle, play tennis, ping pong, and travel. I've been lucky enough to see a lot of North America while on tour with my band back in the day and I hope to make it to Europe sometime next year.</p>

      <p>I'm incredibly persistent and self-motivated. I'm very excited at the prospect of attending General Assembly and feel I have what it takes to be a successful student. I believe in the success of the curriculum as well as the programs investment with each students success.</p>
